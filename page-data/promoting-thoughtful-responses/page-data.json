While I believe strong asynchronous communication processes as vital for any distributed org, what might be a prerequisite to that is that the org values and greatly encourages <em>thoughtful responses</em> over <em>immediate responses</em>.</p>\n<p>This is related but not restricted to async comms. Synchronous comms such as meetings can be thoughtful, too. And asynchronous comms are often curt, vague, or unclear. In my mind this is a value that needs to be in place at an organization before a major effort to go more asynchronous.</p>\n<p>What can we do as managers or individual contributors to exhort our teams towards thoughtful communication?</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-thoughtful-better\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-is-thoughtful-better\" aria-label=\"why is thoughtful better permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why is thoughtful better?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"right--immediate\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#right--immediate\" aria-label=\"right  immediate permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Right > Immediate</h3>\n<p>When I think back on my career I can remember dozens of “brainstorming” sessions or “fact finding” meetings where responses are given off the cuff. Very few times can I remember a boss asking me a question and saying, “take a few hours and really think about this before responding.” Often I’ve seen push back from experienced developers asking for time to research answers to questions they don’t know the answer rather than give a snap reply, having learned better.</p>\n<p>It seems as though we believe that we can get “right” answers ad hoc. As leaders, that is what we should optimize for: the right answer. We don’t want to move forward in the wrong direction just to move forward. But how do we get reliable answers? Can it really be done in the seconds after a question is asked?</p>\n<h3 id=\"inclusive\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#inclusive\" aria-label=\"inclusive permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Inclusive</h3>\n<p>There’s an exclusivity to seeking immediate rather than thoughtful responses. Let’s say we’re in a large meeting, 20 people or so, and we’re discussing a topic and asking a number of questions. Inherently, this format will favor those who are most comfortable speaking up in front of a large crowd and putting the spotlight on themselves. While I myself as a white male have rarely felt insecure not to bloviate on a topic I know little about, the same can’t be said of all my colleagues. If you’ve ever worked on a multi-lingual team, how much of the way you seek info favors native English speakers?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if we’re using a tool like an instant messenger to find immediate answers, and we present questions as needing immediate responses, that will also favor our most experienced people. We’ll miss out on an opportunity for junior people to grow by fact finding themselves. The rich will only get richer, and we’ll continue to silo knowledge with a few responsive experienced teammates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-organizational-memory\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#creating-organizational-memory\" aria-label=\"creating organizational memory permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Creating organizational memory</h3>\n<p>As managers we have to be thinking long term, too. Not only do we want to promote acting on the <em>right</em> answers, ideally we are creating organizational memory so that we’re not asking the same questions over and over. One of the thing I’m very cautious of is repeating mistakes. We should be moving our people from saying things like, “well I think we did it this way because” to “here in the design document it outlines the reasoning of that decision.”</p>\n<p>The medium in which we ask our questions often determines if the answer is documented at all, and whether or not we can benefit from it in the future or it just disappears into the ether.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-it-so-hard-to-be-thoughtful\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-makes-it-so-hard-to-be-thoughtful\" aria-label=\"what makes it so hard to be thoughtful permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What makes it so hard to be thoughtful</h2>\n<h3 id=\"we-are-addicted-to-immediacy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#we-are-addicted-to-immediacy\" aria-label=\"we are addicted to immediacy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>We are addicted to immediacy</h3>\n<p>It’s not just Slack. It’s text messaging. It’s ChatGPT. We’re wired to get an answer ASAP. And oh yeah, it also feels real good to answer questions immediately.</p>\n<p>This has created an environment where availability is now a metric to judge employees. And answering in real time also gives us the sense of productivity even if we completely distracted ourselves from a more important task. Now, we’re always on, ready to snipe with <em>any</em> answer regardless if it’s right. I love this quote from the article I linked above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>slack comes in and makes ‘work’ visible in the form of instant replies to quick questions, dancing emoji stickers, and nonstop chatter, and some people are like, ‘yes! look at all that my team has accomplished’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the same reason we don’t want to create a work culture where just showing up at the office is counted as productivity, we don’t want to reward people or ourselves for giving vague wrong answers to questions in a message just to prove avaiability. You want people solving valuable problems for your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"we-dont-have-any-margin-or-the-resources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#we-dont-have-any-margin-or-the-resources\" aria-label=\"we dont have any margin or the resources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>We don’t have any margin or the resources</h3>\n<p>If you looked at my calendar you might have a bit more sympathy for the way that I ask questions. I’m often instant messaging <em>while in a meeting</em>. I often ask a question just as a thought placeholder so I know to come back to it. “Here, let me distract you just so that I don’t forget.” This is bad; this needs to change.</p>\n<p>But even if I had the time, it’s not a given that a place exists to find the answer. If I have to rely on other people to get questions answered, this means I’m vulnerable to them leaving. A lack of organizational memory is risky business. Knowledge should get out of people’s heads as much as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-we-promote-this-as-managers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-do-we-promote-this-as-managers\" aria-label=\"how do we promote this as managers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How do we promote this as managers?</h2>\n<p>So, what can we do as leaders to turn the tide?</p>\n<h3 id=\"thoughtful-responses-begin-with-thoughtful-questions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#thoughtful-responses-begin-with-thoughtful-questions\" aria-label=\"thoughtful responses begin with thoughtful questions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Thoughtful responses begin with thoughtful questions</h3>\n<p>As leaders we have to control how we ask questions, when we ask questions, and where we ask questions.</p>\n<p>Before pinging an employee with an instant message, even in a public channel, I ask myself if its worth distracting them.
