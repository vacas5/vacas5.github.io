I decided to talk about the pitfalls of refactoring code, particularly if you are not disciplined in doing so. I called it ‘“This Code Sucks” and other tales of developer hubris’. Later in February 2017 I gave this talk again at <a href=\"https://www.pytennessee.org/\">PyTennessee</a> in Nashville, with a few of my code examples ported over to Python rather than JavaScript. <a href=\"http://russelljanderson.com/refactor-slides/#/\">Slides from that talk can be found here</a>. It’s a fun talk that I would like to expand and give again, and applies across programming languages to web development in general.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/cMxI8n393ZM/0.jpg\" alt=\"Poster from my YouTube recorded talk\"></p>\n<p>In November of 2017 I spoke at <a href=\"http://nodevember.org/\">Nodevember</a>, an excellent JavaScript conference in my hometown of Nashville. This talk, “Fizz buzzkill - Answering tricky JS interview questions” used a list of made up js interview questions I found as an excuse to talk about some basic JS concepts that can be hard to explain or remember. In fact I should go back and review this talk myself and re-remember some of what I used to know. I had a great time giving this beginner level talk and then discussing the farse that are technical interviews.
