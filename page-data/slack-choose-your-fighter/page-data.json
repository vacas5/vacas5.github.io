First, Slack stands for “searchable log of all communication and knowledge”. If you let it, Slack can act as an archive of decisions: when they were made and the reasoning behind them. This knowledge is lost forever, though, if it occurred in a DM, especially if one of the parties has left the organization. By gathering facts in a public channel, you not only make that conversation available to a wider possible audience (now or in the future), but it’s more easily found when you need to reference it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it’s important to understand that DMs will be received as SUPER URGENT no matter if you mean it that way. An @mention in a channel will be perceived as less urgent. Using someone’s name in a question in a public channel without a mention: even less urgent. This is good! We should reserve the urgency of DMs or @mentions for when we really need it. We also should consider whether what we’re asking truly needs to be answered right away.</p>\n<p>Asking in public channels also gives others the opportunity to respond to your question, rather than one individual. You may <em>think</em> you know who has the answer, but there may be several more who could help you.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, by gathering facts in a public channel you’re creating a place for everybody to learn! Maybe there are other people on that team who had that question as well. You now have your answer and can link it to anyone in the organization if they have the same question. Impossible with DMs.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s an optics issue at play, too. Imagine DMs as a side conversation at the office where you are whispering to each other, or like a meeting behind closed doors. How would that look to other employees? If you are solving problems that you are concerned about a wider audience overhearing (overreading?), this may be an indicator of other cultural issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"managing-channel-proliferation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#managing-channel-proliferation\" aria-label=\"managing channel proliferation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Managing channel proliferation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer, more active channels</li>\n<li>Temporary channels are better than group DMs</li>\n<li>Follow a naming convention</li>\n<li>Define them</li>\n<li>Actively archive them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without knowing anything about your company I feel confident saying that you have too many channels. Does your company have more channels than employees?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://slack.com/features/channels\">Channels are a great way to organize your work</a>, but they are not very discoverable. As I mentioned above, a major benefit of Slack is the ability to <em>come back to</em> decisions that were made and whey. Proliferating discussions or topics off into myriad channels makes this much harder. “What channel did I have that conversation in?” <strong>I recommend fewer, albeit noisier channels</strong>.</p>\n<p>Often, I’ve observed teams want to integrate some kind of webhook for notifications, and create a channel for them so that a primary channel isn’t bombarded with alerts. Inevitably, these notification only channels get muted and ignored. Try and preserve alerts and bots for only things that are worthy of interruption, like a major outage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organise-discussions-\">Threads</a> should be heavily utilized if there are fewer channels. However, in some cases you might want to split a particular conversation off into a DM if you expect it to last hours or days. Following up on my advice above, I think temporary channels are better for this purpose, because they won’t automatically send alerts for every message (as is the Slack default for DMs). It’s also easier to add additional people into the conversation and they can get the earlier context. Just don’t forget to archive it!</p>\n<p>When you go to create a channel, make sure you’re asking the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the exact purpose of this channel?</li>\n<li>Is there another channel that would also encompass this topic?</li>\n<li>How will the necessary parties discover this channel?</li>\n<li>When should this channel cease to exist? Who will archive it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creating a naming convention for channels such as #team-whatever or #project-whatever can really help enforce that channels have a defined purpose. Regardless, be sure to define every channel you create, and make sure someone in your organization is actively hunting for channels that can be archived.</p>\n<h3 id=\"communicate-your-availability\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#communicate-your-availability\" aria-label=\"communicate your availability permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Communicate your availability</h3>\n<p>Going on vacation?
